Our data represents information on the performance of students and schools. We calculated totals for schools, students, budget, average math scores, average reading scores, percent passing math, percent passing reading, and overall passing rate. 

We found that the top performing schools by overall passing rate were all charter schools and the bottom performers by overall passing rate were district high schools. We also found that smaller schools tend to have a higher overall passing rate compared to larger schools. We would have to do further testing to see if any other variable impact these results.
